‚óè Here are the recommended ways to run and test the game:

  1. Using the provided script (recommended)

  cd /home/cai/3d_fosho
  ./run_game.sh

  This script:
  - Sets optimal environment variables for Linux
  - Checks system OpenGL capabilities
  - Verifies library dependencies
  - Launches the game with proper configuration

  2. Direct execution

  cd /home/cai/3d_fosho/build
  ./ArcadeFPS

  3. Testing the game functionality

  Once the window appears, you can test these features:

  Controls:
  - WASD - Move around
  - Space - Jump
  - Mouse - Look around
  - Left Mouse Button - Shoot
  - P - Pause game
  - R - Restart game (when game over)
  - Escape - Exit game

  What to verify:
  - Window displays properly (should show a 3D scene)
  - Camera movement responds to mouse
  - Player movement works with WASD keys
  - Physics simulation is running (objects fall with gravity)
  - UI elements visible (crosshair, health bar, score)
  - Enemies spawn and move around
  - Shooting creates projectiles

  4. If the window doesn't appear

  Try these troubleshooting steps:

  # Check if X11 is running
  echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE

  # Force X11 if using Wayland
  export SDL_VIDEODRIVER=x11
  export GDK_BACKEND=x11
  ./build/ArcadeFPS

  # Check OpenGL support
  glxinfo | grep "OpenGL version"

  # Run with different render system
  export OGRE_RTT_MODE=FBO
  ./build/ArcadeFPS

  5. Monitor performance

  The game shows FPS stats in the bottom-left corner. You should see smooth 60+ FPS on most modern systems.

  The game is now properly configured for Ubuntu Linux and should display the window correctly with all the OGRE Next 3.0 fixes applied!
